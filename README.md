## Built With

Only using laravel framework with its features.

## Features

Several laravel feature implementations:
* Database structure, we design simple database structure, it might be not strictly `normal`, but we believe its enough to production requirements.
* Migration, all database structure and record has been covered by migration, simply run migration.
* Validation by using form request, with validation input preparation (in sales and purchase route) and passes validation input manipulation.
* We made controller as simple as possible, with only responsible to interact with database and return resource
* Model relationship, we cover relationships as much and as standard as possible, including many-to-many with pivot (in sale and purchase item models)
